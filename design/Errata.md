Errata, rev3:
=============

* NPN Transistor must sink to ground; it is on the wrong side
* NPN Transistor must have a 440 Ohm resistor in series on its Base pin to reduce current
* NPN Transistor connects to digital 4, not 0
* Dallas 1-wire connects to digital 3, not 1
* Button added to digital 2
* Button uses striped orange Cat5 wire and the 5V brown cat5 wire
* Button has 1k pull-down resistor to ground
* Digital 0 and 1 are USB/serial and should be NC
* Diode is pictured backward
* Radio Shack relay is longer than pictured, causing it not to fit
* Terminals pictured were unavailable; real terminals are 3 pins wide with only 2 pins terminating
